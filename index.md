## About Me
Hi, I'm Xieyuan (Francis) Zhang, welcome to my homepage!

I'm a first-year MS student in Department of Mechanical Engineering, Stanford University. Before entering Stanford, I received my bachelor degree from Department of Automotive Engineering, Tsinghua University.

During my undergrad my major interest is **advanced vehicle propulsion systems**. I was fortunate to work on vehicular proton-exchange membrane fuel cell(PEMFC) under supervision of Prof. Liangfei Xu in my junior and senior year. In summer 2017, I was a visiting scholar at Center for Automotive Research, the Ohio State University to work on plug-in hybrid electric vehicle(PHEV) truck under supervision of Prof. Giorgio Rizzoni.

Currently my research interest lies in **human-robot interaction**, with its application on safe and efficient autonomous driving: how self-driving vehicles should "behave" when sharing the road with human-driven vehicles in a mixed traffic flow.
