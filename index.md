## About Me
Hi, I'm Xieyuan (Francis) Zhang, welcome to my homepage!

I'm a first-year MS student in Department of Mechanical Engineering, Stanford University. Before entering Stanford, I received my bachelor degree from Department of Automotive Engineering, Tsinghua University in 2018.

During my undergrad I focused on **advanced vehicle propulsion systems**. I was fortunate to work on vehicular proton-exchange membrane fuel cell(PEMFC) under supervision of [Prof. Liangfei Xu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=jGWQpRkAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) in my senior year. In summer 2017, I was a visiting scholar at [Center for Automotive Research](https://car.osu.edu), The Ohio State University to work on powertrain control and optimization of plug-in hybrid electric truck under supervision of [Prof. Giorgio Rizzoni](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=jtephu8AAAAJ&hl=en), [Dr. Daniel Jung](http://users.isy.liu.se/en/fs/daner/) and [Dr. Qadeer Ahmed](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZQost2wAAAAJ&hl=en).

My research interest is **optimization and optimal control in mixed-autonomy traffic**.

## Projects
- Stabilizing traffic using inverse reinforcement learning
![irl.png](Francis777.github.io/assets/img/irl.png)
This project aims at exploring the potential of attenuating velocity perturbation in a mixed traffic flow using a learning approach where expert demonstration comes from acceleration feedback-based connected car-following behavior. In other words, we obtain the reward function of the autonomous vehicle using inverse reinforcement learning and see if it can ”learn” such optimal behavior without knowledge of the preceding vehicle’s acceleration in real time.

- Measurement and evaluation of water&gas spatial distribution in PEM fuel cell

- Design space exploration for series plugin hybrid electric delivery truck

- Design and simulation of left turn prohibition-based urban transportation system
